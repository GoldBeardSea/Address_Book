##Hello All

This is a project demo that is an example of creating a script that can upload a csv file and create an address book 
consisting of households, and entries. There is an additional command interface where you can add entries into the book.
However, without a persistent database, which can be added, it will only keep additions while the program is running. 

Some additional expansions that can improve the application is the addition of persistence, further input validation,
and standardization of addresses and possibly the creation of a specific address class to standardize and handle for user input discrepencies. 

Additional comments within the code explain the thought process behind the design choices.
